# hsc-sgpurity
Assess the purity of the HSC star galaxy separator developed by Jose Garmilla.

In order to get the code to run out-of-the-box, download the HST-COSMOS catalogs from https://github.com/lsst-dm/sgsupervised into a folder called `input/`. See that repository for information about the star-galaxy classifier.
