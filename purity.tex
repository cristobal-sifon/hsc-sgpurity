To assess the contamination of our source sample, we use observations of the 
COSMOS field, carried out to the same depth as the HSC wide survey. We analyze 
these data in the same way as the nominal survey data as described above, and 
compare the resulting source catalog to the object catalog produced by 
\cite{leauthaud07} based on the deep HST observations of the same field.
In Figure X we show the fraction of stars in the HSC catalog that are classified 
as galaxies in the HST catalog.
